## Fourier Gauss
Here are some notes, just to keep track of what I am doing.

**Home**

Each page of my site is broken into sections. There are three pages, Home, About, and Contact. For
the Home page the sections provided by the template are:

-       'hero'
-       'theme-features'
-       'features'
-       'contact-us'
-       'affiliates'
-       'social-media'
-       'keep-in-touch'
-       'newsletter'
-       'pro-features'
-       'info'

The sections I will keep are:

-       'hero'
-       'theme-features' (open projects)
-       'features' (entreprenuers, developers, investors)
-       'social-media'
-       'info' (maybe)

**About**

For the About page, the sections are:

-        'hero-alt'
-        'about-our-product'
-        'theme-features'
-        'affiliates'
-        'newsletter'
-        'pro-features'
-        'info'

The sections I will keep are:

-        'hero-alt'
-        'about-our-product' (keep it, but decide on the content)
-        'theme-features' (open projects)
-        'info'

**Contact**

For the Contact page, the sections are

-        'hero-alt',
-        'keep-in-touch',
-        'map',
-        'newsletter',
-        'pro-features',

The sections I will keep are:

-        'hero-alt',
-        'keep-in-touch',
-        'info'

### Content

I will need to decide whether I will change the existing section, or whether I will clone it
and create a new one. I am leaning toward the latter approach.

**Home**

The home page has five sections. Here is the content for these ...

*hero*

The company tag line is: Bring ideas to life
The pitch text is ...

```
The next great app may only exist as a drawing on a cocktail napkin. Fourier Gauss Labs are the builders that will transform that sketch into a working prototype; perfect for entreprenuers who need to build technology fast. And a great place for developers looking to create something new.
```

The *discover more* button should route to the About page
The *get started now* link should route to the Contact page

*theme-features*

The title shall be: "Project in the Lab".
The section descriptive text shall be ...

```
Say something
```


*features*

Describe the hero content here.

*social-media*

Describe the hero content here.

*info*

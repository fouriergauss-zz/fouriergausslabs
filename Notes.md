## Fourier Gauss
Here are some notes, just to keep track of what I am doing.

**Home**

Each page of my site is broken into sections. There are three pages, Home, About, and Contact. For
the Home page the sections provided by the template are:

-       'hero'
-       'theme-features'
-       'features'
-       'contact-us'
-       'affiliates'
-       'social-media'
-       'keep-in-touch'
-       'newsletter'
-       'pro-features'
-       'info'

The sections I will keep are:

-       'hero'
-       'theme-features' (open projects)
-       'features' (entreprenuers, developers, investors)
-       'social-media'
-       'info' (maybe)

**About**

For the About page, the sections are:

-        'hero-alt'
-        'about-our-product'
-        'theme-features'
-        'affiliates'
-        'newsletter'
-        'pro-features'
-        'info'

The sections I will keep are:

-        'hero-alt'
-        'about-our-product' (keep it, but decide on the content)
-        'theme-features' (open projects)
-        'info'

**Contact**

For the Contact page, the sections are

-        'hero-alt',
-        'keep-in-touch',
-        'map',
-        'newsletter',
-        'pro-features',

The sections I will keep are:

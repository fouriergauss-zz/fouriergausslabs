## Fourier Gauss
Here are some notes, just to keep track of what I am doing.

**Home**

Each page of my site is broken into sections. There are three pages, Home, About, and Contact. For
the Home page the sections provided by the template are:

- hero
- theme-features
- features
- contact-us
- affiliates
- social-media
- keep-in-touch
- newsletter
- pro-features
- info

The sections I will keep are:

- hero
- theme-features (open projects)
- features (entreprenuers, developers, investors)
- social-media
- info (maybe)

**About**

For the About page, the sections are:

-  hero-alt
-  about-our-product
-  theme-features
-  affiliates
-  newsletter
-  pro-features
-  info

The sections I will keep are:

-  hero-alt
-  about-our-product (keep it, but decide on the content)
-  theme-features (open projects)
-  info

**Contact**

For the Contact page, the sections are

-  hero-alt
-  keep-in-touch
-  map
-  newsletter
-  pro-features

The sections I will keep are:

-  hero-alt
-  keep-in-touch
-  info

### Content

I will need to decide whether I will change the existing section, or whether I will clone it
and create a new one. I am leaning toward the latter approach.

**Home**

The home page has five sections. Here is the content for these ...

*hero*

The company tag line is: Bring ideas to life
The pitch text is ...

```
The next great app may only exist as a drawing on a cocktail napkin. Fourier Gauss Labs are the builders
that will transform that sketch into a working prototype; perfect for entreprenuers who need to build
technology fast. And a great place for developers looking to create something new.
```

The *discover more* button should route to the About page
The *get started now* link should route to the Contact page

*theme-features*

The title shall be: "Projects in the Lab".
The section descriptive text shall be ...

```
Fourier Gauss was formed to provide a resource to entreprenuers and other "idea people" who don't
have the technical skills to build their vision. Our mission is to help launch businesses by creating
working prototypes of their creator's idea. Fourier Gauss has expertise in computer science, cloud
architecture, machine learning, and UX design. We are committed to the principles of rapid application
development. But Fourier Gauss Labs is more than computer programmers! We are the intersection
technology, entreprenuership, and investment. Oh yeah, we do consulting too.
```

List the current projects. There should be between four and six.

```
LET'S HANG
Let's Hang is a mobile app creating to make getting together in-person easier. It shouldn't
be hard for friends to set up a time and place to hang out.
```
```
ALGEBRAIC MACHINE LEARNING
As an alternative to statistical learning, algebraic learning may offer
advantages in combining bottom-up and top-down information, formal concept
derivation from data and large-scale parallelization.
```
```
PROJECT WATERMELON
Nevermind the cute project name. A Broker Price Opinion is a report that is prepared by a real estate agent that details the likely selling price of a house. Watermelon computes that price.
```
```
STEALTH PROJECTS
Entreprenuers and start-ups are often very protective of their projects. Fourier Gauss is respectful of
the need for confidentiality. We'd love to tell you about our cool work, but sometimes we can't.
```

*features*

Describe four aspects of technology here.

```
MODERN DESIGN
We build mobile and web applications. We follow Material Design guidelines to build modern and clean
UX quickly. 
```
```
CLOUD COMPUTING
Our team is cloud agnostic. Our products and protypes can target any of the major cloud platforms
from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
```
```
DATA SCIENCE
We understand that data is at the heart of all modern apps. Our experts will build and test
machine learning models to power our products.
```
```
RAPID APPICATION DEVELOPMENT
We are passionate believers in rapid application development through Agile methods and continuous
delivery. Nevermind the jargon; we're fast.
```

*social-media*

Follow us for the latest updates, news, and technical tips from fourier gauss labs. 

Remove the link (to Vuetify). It's not necessary here.
Open a Twitter account. And tweet.

*info*

I think I should remove the info section, at least until I have email addresses and phone numbers
that I want to publish.
